A SIMPLE MATHEMATICS QUIZ

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/8rmnjJdOc_0

Hi!! I have completed my CS50P this week and for final project I have made a short and simple game named as "A Simple Mathematics Quiz".
Here in this I have used all the required functions which were mentioned in the project's reuqirements, and it's a fun and
mind refreshing game for all. 

In this I have incorportated the basic mathematics functions which are : addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
My project is too easy to run just need to go in the terminal click on run and the quiz will get started. The user will get
the choice to select from which function does he want to begin with in the order of 1,2,3,4,5 i.e. addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division and exit respectivley.

The user once he selects the option the question will be given to him as he attempts the choice will be given to him as what 
next question(and on which function) would he like to chose. As the user gives the answer he will be told that the answer
reported by him is the correct or not, for every correct the point (in form of percentage) gets stored in the scorecard
and the same for wrong answers.

Now, when the user choses '5' in the terminal window he will get the number of questions he attempted with the correct ones,
and the incorrect one's and a total percentage of how much he got correct will be shown to him, and the game/quiz will stop
by 'Thank you visit again'.

So that was my project for CS50P, hope you loved this a short and simple effort of mine for this one and I promise I will
improved in the upcoming days and will make good than this too need your wishes

Thanks!!
